\section{HDMI}
Video can be transferred between devices in a variety of ways, one of which is the \emph{High-Definition Multimedia Interface} (HDMI).
The HDMI cable can carry audio, Ethernet and other information in addition to the video stream itself, but we will focus on the video stream in this report.

\subsection{Transition-Minimized Differential Signaling}
HMDI employs Transition-Minimized differential signaling to make high-speed transfers more reliable.

The technology is based on twisted pairs of cables transferring data using a differential encoding.
This encoding uses two cables for each bit and inverts the voltage difference between the cables in a pair whenever the bit represented by the pair should change.
Notice that, for the same voltage, this doubles the distance between the high and low states compared to using only a single cable and ground.
The lack of a need for a common ground also eliminates problems related to ground offset.

TMDS transfers 10 bits at a time using an encoding that minimizes the number of transitions required between each set of bits.
