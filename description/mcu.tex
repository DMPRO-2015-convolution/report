The FPGA an the MCU is connected through an EBI bus.
This interface is supported natively by the MCU and can therefore be handled by its built-in direct memory access (DMA) unit, which hopefully makes streaming video from the MCU both faster and more reliable.

In addition to streaming video, the MCU should also control the operation of Daisy.
To accomplish this, we utilize the large address space available.
An overview can be seen in figure \ref{fig:EbiAddressSpace}.

\subsubsection{Daisy Configuration}
Configuration values for Daisy have their own memory addresses so that configuring daisy is only a matter of saving the correct values to the correct addresses.

\subsubsection{Streaming data}
Some data is of unknown or unlimited length. This data is streamed to daisy by reusing the same addresses several times.
By assigning a large block of the memory space to each data stream, we can utilize the DMA without having to worry about unintendedly overwriting configuration values.
