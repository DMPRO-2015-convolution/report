\section{Convolution}
\subsection{Calculus}
Mathematically, convolution is an operation that maps two input functions to an output function:

\[
    (f * g)(t) = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}{f(\tau)g(t-\tau) d\tau}
\]

Its discrete counterpart is:

\[
    (f * g)(n) = \sum^{\infty}_{m=-\infty}{f(m)g(n-m)}
\]

A monochrome image can be thought of as a 2D matrix with a width $W$ and height $H$.
Let $I(x, y)$ be a function for accessing a specific value in the image matrix.
Let $K(x', y')$ be a function for accessing a specific value in a special matrix called the \textit{kernel},
or $0$ if $x'$ or $y'$ is out of bounds for the matrix.

The convolution of the image and the kernel is then:
\[
    C(x, y) = \sum^{H}_{h=0} \sum^{W}_{w=0}{I(w, h)K(w - x, h -y)}
\]

Depending on the kernel matrix,
various effects like blurring or sharpening may be applied to the image with convolution.
For a colored RGB image convolution is performed once per color channel.

\subsection{Matrix Operation}
As described above, an image and a kernel may be convolved with pure calculus by defining functions for accessing matrices.
By imposing restrictions on the dimensions of the kernel matrix we can conceptualize the convolution process in a way that lends itself well to processing images:
We let the kernel matrix be a square matrix with side length $D$, hereby referred to as the kernel dimensions.
We then change the definition of the kernel function $K(x', y')$ to evaluate to $0$ whenever $x'$ or $y'$ is outside of the kernel matrix bounds.

Imposing this restriction on the kernel function means each pixel in the image matrix is a function of its neighbourhood rather than the entire image.
To visualize this, for each pixel in the image matrix, overlay the kernel with its center on the currently evaluated pixel.
Each neighbour pixel, including the center which is its own neighbour, is multiplied with its corresponding kernel value relative to the center pixel.
For each multiplication the result is summed, and the final sum represents the output pixel.

\subsection{Abstracting convolution}
We can abstract the convolution process by using mapping function $f: R x R \rightarrow R$ in place of multiplication, and $g: R x R \rightarrow R$ in place of addition.
A convolution can then be described as $(f, g)$, where the standard convolution can be expressed as $(*, +)$, while the mapping operators $(min, +)$ describes finding the shortest path.
The only restriction we impose on $f$ and $g$ is that they form a semiring.
Abstract algebra is outside of the scope of our report, but informally we impose that the TODO
