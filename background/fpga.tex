TODO: Small section on FPGA and how it can work as reconfigurable hardware. Our system can reconfigure this at runtime. Make this a point later?

An FPGA is an integrated circuit which is designed to be configured after it has been manufactured. It consists of reconfigurable logic blocks and connections between them. The configuration of an FPGA can be specified by a hardware description language.

Because an FPGA is reconfigurable hardware, it can be reconfigured at will. In our system we are using this feature to reconfigure the FPGA at runtime.
