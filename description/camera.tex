\section{Raspberry Pi Camera}
After some consideration it was decided that the \textit{Raspberry Pi Camera Board}\footnote{\url{https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/}} would be used as the camera module for the system.
The \textit{Raspberry Pi Foundation} has designed this peripheral for use with the \textit{Raspberry Pi} computer.

There were several advantages leading to this choice, including
\begin{itemize}
    \item   Availability from retailers
    \item   Associated open source software
    \item   Wdiely used in other projects, meaning there is a lot of experience to draw from
\end{itemize}

The camera module can take still shots as well as record continuous video.
The camera sensor sits on a board with a controller unit which connects to the Pi (or another master device) via a 16-pin ribbon cable.
Communication over this cable is defined by the proprietary \textit{MIPI Camera Serial Interface} (CSI) specification.

The master device controls the camera module by sending instructions over an I2C bus on the ribbon cable,
and the camera module responds with picture data over two clocked differential busses.
Parameters that may be controlled include video encoding, resolution in two dimensions and framerate.
