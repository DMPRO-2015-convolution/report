\subsection{SD Card Video}
One possible source of video is a file stored on the SD card connected to the board.
The MCU is able to open files and pass the data from it to the processor.
For simplicity we decided to not implement any video decoding schemes here.
Only reading still images from the BMP format and raw RGB data from a video dump was implemented.

TODO is this above correct?
