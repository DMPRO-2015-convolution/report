\chapter{Introduction}
This report present the results from the \textit{TDT4295 Computer Design Project} course at \textit{The Norwegian University of Science and Technology} for the \textit{Camvolution} group.
In this course groups of students design and create their own computers from scratch.

The task for the Camvolution group is to create a computer optimized for performing convolution on two-dimensional data.
The processor should be able to take images and convolution kernels as input, perform the convolution, and output the convolved images.

The processor architecture should be implemented on a Xilinx FPGA, and a Silicon Labs EFM32 series microcontroller should act as an I/O processor.
The output from the processor should be displayed for demonstration purposes.
This project has a budget of 10.000 NOK.
