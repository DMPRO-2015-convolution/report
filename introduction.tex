This report present the results from the TDT4295 Computer Design Project course at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, where groups of students are to design and create their own computers.

The task for this project is to create a processor optimized for performing convolution on two-dimensional data. The processor should be able to take images and convolution kernels as input, perform the convolution, and output the convolved images.

The processor architecture should be implemented on a Xilinx FPGA, and a Silicon Labs EFM32 series microcontroller should act as an I/O processor. The output from the processor should be displayed for demonstration purposes. This project has a budget of 10.000 NOK.
