\subsection{Comments on Design Faults}
The amount of design faults on this board is not that many, and the few we had was not that difficult to make workarounds for.
If we could make a second revision of the board, we would fix the design faults.
We would also add more LEDs, to make it easier for debugging, and support a USB interface to the computer.
