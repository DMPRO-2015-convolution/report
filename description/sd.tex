\subsection{SD Card Video}
One possible source of video is a file stored on the SD card connected to the board.
The MCU is able to open files and pass the data from it to the processor over EBI.
For simplicity of development the MCU should not need to handle encoded video. Instead, the video files should contain raw pixel data so that it can easily be streamed to the processor.
