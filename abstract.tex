\chapter*{Abstract}
This report presents the results of the fall 2015 TDT4295 course at NTNU for the \textit{Camvolution} group.

\textit{Camvolution} is a computer designed and built from scratch PCB dev-board for the purpose of performing 2D convolution on a video stream.
It receives an external video input stream,
performs convolution on the frames of the stream,
then outputs the manipulated stream to HDMI.
