\section{Further Work}

Unfortunately, this project has a limited timeframe.
Had we had more time, we would have prioritized working on the following:

\subsection{Camera}

In order to achieve camera input as originally intended, we would go back to some of the other camera modules we looked at, and find a more suitable module.
It would probably to be a good idea to try a module with less features that is simpler to control.

\subsection{PCB}

We would have fixed the HDMI routing errors in the PCB.

We would also add more LEDs, to make it easier to debug.
In addition it would be nice to support a USB interface to the MCU for development and debugging.

\subsection{MCU}

The EBI described in Section \ref{sec:mcu}, was not implemented at the time of the deadline.

\subsection{FPGA}

As mentioned, 3D convolution worked in Chisel test benches, but not when implemented on the FPGA.
We were not able to get to the bottom of why this was by the deadline, but given more time this should be possible.
