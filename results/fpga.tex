\subsection{FPGA Resource Utilization}
The low resource utilization on the FPGA suggests our architecture can be used for larger kernels or can be optimized for higher speed at the cost of more hardware resources.
This is in addition to the higher throughput that can be achieved by clocking the processor higher, which means higher quality video can be processed in real time.

Except from increasing the video quality, the size of the kernel can also be increased.
As the area of the kernel increases in the square of the kernel dimensions, we also expect the hardware requirements to increase quadratically, if not quicker.
