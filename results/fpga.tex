\subsection{FPGA Resource Utilisation}
The low resource utilisation on the FPGA suggests the architecture can be used for larger kernels or can be optimised for higher speed at the cost of more hardware resources.
This is in addition to the higher throughput that can be achieved by clocking the processor faster, which means higher quality video can be processed in real time.

In addition to increasing the video quality, the size of the kernel can also be increased.
As the area of the kernel increases by the square of the kernel size,
the hardware requirements are also expected to increase quadratically,
if not faster.
