\section{Development Tools}
Throughout the development process various tools were used.
This section lists the most important ones.

\begin{description}
    \item[Chisel]
    \hfill\\
    Used to write the processor implementation.
    See section \ref{sec:chisel} for background.
    \item[Xilinx ISE, ISim, Impact]
    \hfill\\
    Used to create various FPGA modules with VHDL and Verilog and make them work together with the processor implementation.
    \item[Simplicity Studio]
    \hfill\\
    Used to develop for and debug the MCU.
    \item[Giant Gecko Development Kit EFM32GG-DK3750]
    \hfill\\
    Used to flash and debug the MCU and to test code during development.
    \item[Saleae Logic Analyzer]
    \hfill\\
    Used to inspect digital communication over various busses during development.
    \item[Altium Designer]
    \hfill\\
    Used to design the PCB layout.
